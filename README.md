## Installation

2. Untar/unzip the plugin's archive.
3. Put files of the plugins to the `<Mibew root>/plugins`  folder.
4. Add plugins definition to "plugins" structure in "`<Mibew root>`/configs/config.yml".
If the "plugins" stucture looks like `plugins: []` it will become:
```yaml
plugins:
    -
        name: "Mibew:Emoji"
```

1. Obtain a copy of the repository using `git clone`, download button, or another way.
2. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).
3. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
4. Install npm dependencies using `npm install`.
